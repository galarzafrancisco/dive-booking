# Dive booking tool
Speed up the check in process for diving operators.

## Motivation
This app is being developed with 3 main goals:
- Learn NestJS
- Learn CockroachDB
- Make fun dives more efficient by reducing the time required for checking in

## History
When you go for a fun dive, you normally need to get some tanks and gear from a dive shop. At the shop you need to check in, they will ask you what you want and get your gear sorted, but this takes a shit load of time because all the divers show up at the same time and the shops get super busy.
The idea of this app is to automate that as much as possible so when you show up to the shop they already know what you want and they have it prepared for you.
